	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// command2Cmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// command2Cmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")

	// This flag stores its value in a named variable
	command2Cmd.Flags().StringVarP(&name, "name", "n", "Stranger", "A name to reference for a custom greeting")
	// This flags value can be looked up with cmd.Flags().GetBool("toggle-name")
	command2Cmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle-name", "t", false, "Toggle name specific greeting")
